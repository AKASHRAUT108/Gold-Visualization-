# Gold Price Prediction Visualization

This project presents an interactive web-based visualization dashboard for exploring historical gold price trends alongside relevant economic indicators (USD Index, Crude Oil Price) and evaluating a simulated gold price prediction model's performance. It serves as a foundational visualization component for machine learning projects focused on time series forecasting.

## Overview

This repository contains a single HTML file (`index.html`) that leverages D3.js and Tailwind CSS to render two interconnected time-series charts:
1.  **Historical Trends:** Displays the simulated movements of Gold Price, USD Index, and Oil Price over time.
2.  **Prediction Performance:** Compares simulated "Actual" gold prices against "Predicted" gold prices to visually assess model accuracy.

The visualization is designed for clarity, aesthetic appeal, and user interaction, making complex data trends accessible and understandable.

## Visualization Objectives

The primary objectives of this visualization are to:
* **Explore Historical Relationships:** Provide a visual understanding of how gold prices have trended historically in relation to factors like the USD Index and Crude Oil Prices, which are commonly used in gold price prediction models.
* **Evaluate Prediction Model Performance:** Offer a clear visual comparison between actual gold prices and a model's predicted output, enabling quick assessment of forecasting accuracy.
* **Enhance Data Storytelling:** Present data in a narrative-driven manner through clear labels, legends, and interactive tooltips to facilitate data interpretation and insights.

## Features & Interactivity

* **Multi-Line Charts:** Uses line charts, ideal for displaying trends over time for multiple variables.
* **Dual Y-Axes:** The historical trends chart utilizes dual Y-axes to effectively plot variables with different scales (Gold Price on left, USD/Oil on right) without distortion.
* **Responsive Design:** The charts adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on various devices.
* **Interactive Tooltips:** Hovering the mouse over any part of the charts reveals a tooltip that displays:
    * The exact date of the data point.
    * The precise values for all relevant metrics (Gold Price, USD Index, Oil Price for the historical chart; Actual and Predicted Gold Price for the performance chart) at that date.
    * Small circles appear on the lines at the hovered data point for precise alignment.

## Data Source & Generation

**Important Note:** The data used in this visualization is **synthetically generated** within the JavaScript code (`index.html` file). This approach was taken because direct access to external datasets or the ability to run machine learning models is not available in the development environment used for this visualization.

The data generation logic (`generateHistoricalData` and `generatePredictionData` functions) is designed to mimic realistic time-series trends and correlations observed in financial markets, providing a representative demonstration of the visualization's capabilities.

## How to View Locally

Due to browser security restrictions (e.g., Chrome's Same-Origin Policy), directly opening the `index.html` file from your local file system (`file:///...`) might prevent the D3.js charts from rendering correctly.

To view the visualization, you need to serve the file using a local web server:

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the `index.html` file from this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved `index.html`.
3.  **Start a Local Server:**
    * **Using Python (recommended):** `python -m http.server 8000` (for Python 3)
    * **Using Node.js (if `http-server` is installed):** `http-server -p 8000`
    * **Using VS Code Live Server Extension:** Right-click `index.html` in VS Code and select "Open with Live Server".
4.  **Access in Browser:** Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/`.
